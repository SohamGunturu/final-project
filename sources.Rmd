## What dataset was used and how was it used
**databank.worldbank.org**

I used the databank.worldbank website to access my data set. My data set examines the number of deaths for children under 5 per 1000 lives births in different countries, income statuses, and regions. I used the data to study 3 different trends:


1. Death count vs. Year
2. Death count vs. Country
3. Death count vs. Socioeconomic Class
