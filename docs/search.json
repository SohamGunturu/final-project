      "contents": "\nIntrodcution\nMany kids throughout the world never make it past the hospital due to\nvarious complications, illnesses, and other factors. How can we prevent\nthis? What type of area is this common in? Is this problem being\naddressed? These are the questions we hope to answer in this analysis.\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges as time progresses.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows an inverse relationship. This makes sense because as\nwe become more modern, so does our technology and medical services. With\nbetter medical services, we are able to save more children from death.\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges in different countries. The US has a GDP of $19.485 trillion,\nChina has a GDP of $12.238 trillion, Brazil has a GDP of $2.054\ntrillion, Mexico has a GDP of $1.151 trillion, Peru has a GDP of $211\nbillion.\n\n\n\nThe following graph provides evidence that on average, countries with\nhigher GDPs have lower death counts and vice versa. This graph will\nexamine how the mortality rate of children under five changes in\ndifferent socioeconomic classes.\n\n\n\nAs income increases, death count decreases. This makes sense because\nhigher income families can afford better care for their children.\nConclusion\nFrom these graphs we can notice three trends: 1. The death count\ndecreases as time goes on 2. More developed countries have a lower death\ncount 3. Higher income families have, on average, a lower death\ncount\nThe trends in 2 and 3 are troubling. The people in need in these\nareas are not receiving any. This is a problem that affects the future\nheavily, and it needs to be brought to attention. These groups need to\nhave the resources in order to be able to afford medical services for\ntheir children.\n\n\n\n",
