This makes sense because as we become more modern, so does\nour technology and medical services. With better medical services, we\nare able to save more children from death.\n\n\n\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges in different countries. The United States is a 1st world\ncountry, China is a 2nd world country, and India is a third world\ncountry. The following graph provides evidence that higher world\ncountries have less death and vice versa. This makes sense because\ntechnologically advanced countries can provide better medical assistance\nin saving these children.\n\n\n\n“This graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges in different socioeconomic classes. As income increases, death\ncount decreases. This makes sense because higher income families can\nafford better care for their children.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
