      "contents": "\nIntrodcution\nMany kids throughout the world never make it past the hospital due to\nvarious complications, illnesses, and other factors. How can we prevent\nthis? What type of area is this common in? Is this problem being\naddressed? These are the questions we hope to answer in this\nanalysis.\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges as time progresses.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows an inverse relationship. This makes sense because as\nwe become more modern, so does our technology and medical services. With\nbetter medical services, we are able to save more children from\ndeath.\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges in different countries. The US has a GDP of $19.485 trillion,\nChina has a GDP of $12.238 trillion, Brazil has a GDP of $2.054\ntrillion, Mexico has a GDP of $1.151 trillion, Peru has a GDP of $211\nbillion.\n\n\n\nThe following graph provides evidence that on average, countries with\nhigher GDPs have lower death counts and vice versa.\nThis graph will examine how the mortality rate of children under five\nchanges in different socioeconomic classes.\n\n\n\nAs income increases, death count decreases. This makes sense because\nhigher income families can afford better care for their children.\nConclusion\nFrom these graphs we can notice three trends:\nThe death count decreases as time goes on\nMore developed countries have a lower death count\nHigher income families have, on average, a lower death count\nThe trends in 2 and 3 are troubling. The people in need in these\nareas are not receiving as much medial services as needed. This is a\nproblem that affects the future heavily, and it needs to be brought to\nattention. These groups need to have the resources in order to be able\nto afford medical services for their children.\n\n\n\n",
